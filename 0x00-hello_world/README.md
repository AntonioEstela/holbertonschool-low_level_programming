* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program
